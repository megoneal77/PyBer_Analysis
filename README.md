# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze data for a ride share company. Information was gathered on rural, suburban, and urban ride information including cost per fare, total drivers, location of the fare, etc. This was completed by usig Pandas and Matplotlib. Once the data was configured, the information was provided to the decision makers at PyBer so they could be better informed in the direcetin they wanted to take the company.
##Results
The results show by far, urban areas out perform suburban and rural. This can be seen in the graph below:

Also, there are more drivers in surban areas allowing it to be more successful for PyBer. The average price per fare is highest in urban allowing for greatest profit margins for PyBer.
## Summary!
In summary, according to the data analysis, urban areas get the most traffic and rides. However, according to the chart below, they do not make enough money for the drivers.

PyBer should look into possibly increasing pricing to raise the average fare per driver. This could cause more drivers to join PyBer and the current drivers to drive more rides, thus increasing business.
